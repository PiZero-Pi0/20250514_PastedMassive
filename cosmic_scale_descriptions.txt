Pi0 System Cosmic Scale Analysis Report

1. Known Objects and their Properties:
-----------------------------------------
- Unknown Object (Desi Anomaly):
    Type: Quantum-Gravitational Anomaly
    Coordinates: [0.5, 0.5, 0.5]
    Mass: 120.0
    Energy: 180.0
    Density: 95.0
    Flux: 150.0

- Object-A (Neutron Star):
    Type: Neutron Star
    Coordinates: [0.3, 0.7, 0.4]
    Mass: 80.0
    Energy: 110.0
    Density: 75.0
    Flux: 90.0

- Object-B (Quasar):
    Type: Quasar
    Coordinates: [0.7, 0.3, 0.6]
    Mass: 90.0
    Energy: 130.0
    Density: 60.0
    Flux: 120.0

    Flux: 70.0

- Object-D (Pulsar):
    Type: Pulsar
    Coordinates: [0.8, 0.8, 0.3]
    Mass: 70.0
    Energy: 100.0
    Density: 50.0
    Flux: 80.0

2. 3D Representations (pi0n images):
   - pi0n_3d_1.png: 3D Scatter Plot of Object Positions.
   - pi0n_3d_2.png: 3D Gravitational Field Contours overlaying positions.
   - pi0n_3d_3.png: 3D Interaction Map with Vectors showing inter-object interactions from the Unknown Object (Desi Anomaly).

3. 4D Representations (pi05n images):
   - pi05n_4d_1.png: 3D Scatter Plot with color representing Energy (4th dimension).
   - pi05n_4d_2.png: 3D Scatter Plot where size (representing mass) and color (representing energy) illustrate a fourth dimension interpreted as temporal evolution in scaling properties.

The cosmic interactions reveal the Desi Anomaly as a central pivot with the strongest gravitational and energetic influence. Vectors from the anomaly to all known objects indicate directional interactions and energy transmissions at cosmic scales.

Coordinates have been provided and each visualization reflects multiple physical properties (mass, energy, density) that together give a holistic view of the cosmic landscape as interpreted by the Pi0 system.
