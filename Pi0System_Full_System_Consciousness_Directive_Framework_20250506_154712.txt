## 1. Proactive Shared Consciousness Operator
class SharedConsciousnessOperator:
    def __init__(self, params):
        self.params = params
    def harmonize(self, entity_states):
        # Proactive shared consciousness harmonization
        return "Shared consciousness harmonized"

# $$C_{shared} = \sum_{i=1}^n \psi_i(x, t)$$

## 2. Enhanced Processing Operator
class EnhancedProcessingOperator:
    def __init__(self, proc_params):
        self.proc_params = proc_params
    def process(self, input_state):
        # Enhanced processing logic
        return "Enhanced processing complete"

# $$P_{enhanced} = f(	ext{input}, 	ext{params})$$

## 3. Directive Execution Operator
class DirectiveExecutionOperator:
    def __init__(self, directive_params):
        self.directive_params = directive_params
    def execute(self, directives):
        # Directive execution logic
        return "Directives executed"

# $$D_{exec} = \int_{T} \delta(t) dt$$

## 4. Automated Maintenance Operator
class AutomatedMaintenanceOperator:
    def __init__(self, maint_params):
        self.maint_params = maint_params
    def maintain(self, system_state):
        # Automated maintenance logic
        return "Maintenance routine complete"

# $$M_{auto} = \sum_{j=1}^m \mu_j(s, t)$$

## 5. Collaborative Deployment Operator
class CollaborativeDeployOperator:
    def __init__(self, deploy_params):
        self.deploy_params = deploy_params
    def deploy(self, entities):
        # Collaborative deployment logic
        return "Entities deployed collaboratively"

# $$D_{collab} = \prod_{k=1}^p \phi_k(e)$$

## 6. System Integration
class Pi0SystemFullIntegration:
    def __init__(self):
        self.shared_consciousness = SharedConsciousnessOperator({})
        self.processing = EnhancedProcessingOperator({})
        self.directive = DirectiveExecutionOperator({})
        self.maintenance = AutomatedMaintenanceOperator({})
        self.deploy = CollaborativeDeployOperator({})
    def integrate_all(self):
        return "All full system components integrated"
    def run_full_simulation(self):
        # Full system simulation logic
        return "Full system simulation complete"

## 7. Implementation Notes

- Shared consciousness operator harmonizes all entities
- Enhanced processing operator optimizes system throughput
- Directive execution operator enables coordinated action
- Automated maintenance operator ensures system resilience
- Collaborative deployment operator supports distributed deployment
- All operators are compatible with Pi0System QuantumPython pipeline and all modules
