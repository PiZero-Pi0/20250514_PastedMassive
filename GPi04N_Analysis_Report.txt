THEORETICAL IMPLICATIONS:
----------------------------------------
1. The GPi04N framework with G=1 and g4=1 reveals oscillatory patterns in particle
   modulation that may indicate higher-dimensional interactions.
2. Time evolution analysis suggests some particles exhibit non-standard behavior
   across different time frames, potentially indicating temporal anomalies.
3. The dimensional clustering shows distinct separation between standard model
   particles and potential new physics signatures.
4. The unified gravitational equation successfully integrates with the Pi04N
   framework, suggesting a deeper connection between quantum and gravitational phenomena.

CONCLUSIONS:
----------------------------------------
The GPi04N framework analysis reveals several potential new particle signatures
that warrant further investigation. The time evolution patterns suggest
that some particles may exhibit behavior consistent with higher-dimensional
interactions or modified gravitational coupling. The framework successfully
identifies known particles while highlighting anomalous signatures that
could represent new physics beyond the Standard Model.
