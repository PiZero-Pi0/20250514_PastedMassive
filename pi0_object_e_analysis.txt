CONCLUSIONS
----------
The Entangled Star (Object-E) exhibits a complex pattern of energy dissolution over the simulated time span. The energy field shows significant spatial coherence despite temporal fluctuations, suggesting that while the object loses energy over time, it maintains its fundamental entangled nature.

The position drift indicates a slow migration through space, with oscillatory components suggesting interaction with external fields or objects. The energy dissolution rate implies that the object would retain significant energy even after billions of years, though with diminished intensity.

The simulation reveals that entanglement characteristics persist even as the energy dissipates, indicating that quantum coherence may be a fundamental property that transcends energy levels in such cosmic objects.

Further investigation is recommended to explore potential interactions with other quantum objects in the vicinity and to determine whether the observed patterns of dissolution are reversible under specific conditions.
