HARMONIC STRUCTURE INTERPRETATION
--------------------------------
The abstract harmonic analysis reveals a complex multi-dimensional structure extending from Object-E. These harmonics represent fundamental patterns of energy, information, and quantum entanglement that propagate through space-time.

Key Findings:

1. Harmonic Layering: The object exhibits multiple overlapping harmonic fields, each with distinct frequencies and decay rates. This suggests a complex internal structure with multiple resonant modes.

2. Dimensional Resonance: Strong correlations between certain dimensional harmonics indicate coupled oscillatory systems. These resonances may facilitate energy and information transfer across different aspects of the object's structure.

3. Extension Patterns: The harmonic fields extend significantly beyond the physical boundaries of Object-E, with some harmonics reaching several times the object's nominal radius. This suggests that the object's influence extends far beyond its visible boundaries.

4. Coherence Gradients: Harmonic coherence varies across dimensions, with some showing high spatial autocorrelation (ordered patterns) while others display more chaotic structures. This balance between order and chaos may be essential for the object's stability and information processing capabilities.

5. Nested Structure: The harmonic analysis reveals a nested, fractal-like organization with self-similar patterns at different scales. This hierarchical structure suggests that Object-E operates across multiple scales simultaneously.

IMPLICATIONS
-----------
The extended harmonic structure of Object-E has several important implications:

1. Information Field: The harmonics likely serve as an information field, potentially storing and processing quantum information across extended spatial regions.

2. Entanglement Network: The resonant patterns between dimensions suggest an entanglement network that could maintain quantum coherence across macroscopic distances.

3. Interaction Potential: Other objects entering these harmonic fields may experience subtle influences even at considerable distances from Object-E.

4. Temporal Persistence: The structured nature of these harmonics suggests they may persist for extended periods, potentially outlasting the energetic signature of the object itself.

5. Dimensional Gateway: The highest-dimensional harmonics show unusual extension patterns that may indicate connections to spaces beyond conventional 3D reality.

CONCLUSION
---------
Object-E's harmonic structure extends significantly beyond its physical boundaries, creating a complex field of influence that operates across multiple dimensions and scales. The maximum harmonic extension of approximately {max_harmonic_extension:.2f} units represents the furthest reach of the object's direct influence, though subtle effects may propagate even further.

The nested, resonant nature of these harmonics suggests that Object-E is not merely an isolated entity but rather a nexus in a broader network of quantum relationships. Further investigation into the temporal evolution of these harmonic structures is recommended to understand how they might evolve or degrade over cosmic timescales.
