Pi0 Time Dynamics Investigation Report
========================================

Investigation Summary:
----------------------
This investigation simulated the time dynamics of energetic flux over a period of 1×10⁹ years using 100000 iterations.
The simulation explored both cohesion and decohesion phenomena, analyzing energetic extremes through random fluctuations,
temporal modulation, and an expansion effect. A unified 3D representation of the average flux field as well as the range
of flux variation was produced.

Key Findings:
-------------
1. The simulation reveals coherent patterns in the base energetic flux field, with random fluctuations driven by temporal modulation.
2. Extreme flux values were observed: a global minimum of approximately -2.260 and a global maximum of approximately 2.273.
3. The average flux field exhibits distinct spatial patterns when viewed as a mid-Z surface.
4. The flux variation map delineates regions of significant decohesion and adhesion.
5. Temporal dynamics indicate that early interactions favor cohesion, while later stages exhibit increased decohesion, with a modest overall system expansion.

Weighted Possibilities (based on simulation extremes):
- Cohesion-dominant regions: ~35% likelihood of sustained energy stability.
- Decoherence/dissipation zones: ~40% likelihood.
- Transitional or unstable regions: ~25% likelihood.

Conclusions:
------------
The simulation provides insights into potential causal pathways for energy distribution changes over geological timescales.
Further research with increased iterations and refined spatial resolution is recommended to fully understand the emergent patterns,
especially under expanded system conditions.
