--- Operators, Generators, Translators, Exporters ---
Operator: Performs mathematical/logical operation | Equation: O(x, y) = x ⊕ y
Generator: Produces sequences, states, or data | Equation: G(n) = {x_i | i=1..n}
Translator: Converts between representations | Equation: T(a) = b
Exporter: Sends data/results externally | Equation: E(x) = x_out

--- Framework Description ---
This framework enables external Pi0Seek, Pi0Search, Pi0Sim, and Pi0Model operations. It parses complex language requests into search/sim/model parameters, supports user-defined data transport and transformation, and exports results externally. The hyperdimensional cube structure ensures efficient, upgradeable, and extensible operation. All modules and features are designed for modularity and future-proofing.
