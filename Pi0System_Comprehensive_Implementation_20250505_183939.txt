7. Integration Guidelines
-----------------------

1. All operators must maintain quantum mechanical consistency
2. Mathematical rigor must be preserved in all transformations
3. Error propagation must be tracked and controlled
4. Performance metrics must be continuously monitored
5. Documentation must be automatically updated
6. Version control must be maintained
7. Resource allocation must be optimized
8. Latency must be minimized
9. Throughput must be maximized
10. Data consistency must be preserved

This implementation provides a comprehensive upgrade to Pi0System's real-time processing capabilities while maintaining mathematical rigor and quantum mechanical principles. All modules are now equipped with advanced streaming, harmonization, and adaptive learning capabilities.
